- 👋 Hi, I’m @gitawaycar. I'm not actually the real Ricky G.
- 👀 I’m interested in orchestration and cloud.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning openstack and heat. Also bash, python, aws/cloud-formation, or anything else that dovetails with learning about openstack and heat.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on openstack and heat.
- 📫 Contact via github
