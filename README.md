- 👋 Hi, I’m @gitawaycar. I'm not actually the real Ricky G.
- 👀 I’m currently interested in orchestration and cloud. Getting better at microservices would also be very cool.
- 🌱 I will probably end up filling this repo with Terraform. Maybe some Terraform for OpenStack. Probably some Terraform for AWS. Maybe also some bash. Some Python if I stop being lazy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the stuff I have mentioned (Terraform, OpenStack, AWS, bash, python)
- 📫 Contact via github. Send Monero to my tax haven, or say yes to the javascript prompt so I can mine some from your device. Just kidding.
